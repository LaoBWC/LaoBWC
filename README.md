# Our Project:2D And 3D Shape Recognition

Our Member:范江 蒋思宏 程彦军 唐鸣跃

Introduction:The goal of shape recognition is, given an image including 2D or 3D shaped object, to recognize whether the object has the same shape as shaped objects in a database. In this project, you need to have at least 10 different 2D shaped objects and 10 different 3D shaped objects in your database. Given a 2D image of a shaped object, your program should be able to automatically identify whether the shape of this object is defined in the database, if yes, what is the shape. Otherwise, return unrecognized shape

The fifth week, our group's main work is as follows:

1)Build a 2d and 3d shape database

2)Read the reference to know the method of shape recognition 

3)To design our shape recognition method


Reference:

1)Object Shape Recognition Using Wavelet Descriptors

2)Learning 2D Shape M-odels
